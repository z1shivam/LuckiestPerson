# Luckiest Person Algorithm - Readme 📜

## Overview

Welcome to the Luckiest Person Algorithm - a specialized JavaScript solution designed to pinpoint that remarkable individual who consistently scores heads in a coin toss. This readme provides an insight into the algorithm's functionality and why it stands out in the world of randomness. 🌐

## Key Features

### 1. **Predictable Outcomes**
   - The algorithm guarantees a winner every time by adhering to a heads outcome in every toss. It's not just a game of chance; it's a heads-hunting expedition. 🏆

### 2. **Conformative Slicing Technique**
   - Employing a strategic slicing approach, the algorithm ensures a heads recipient at each step. No more crossing fingers for randomness; it's about conforming to heads success. ✂️

### 3. **Elimination Drama with a Purpose**
   - Participants may come and go, but the algorithm preserves potential winners, securing heads triumphs until the final champion emerges. 🚪

## Implementation

The algorithm is implemented through a series of functions like `createArray`, `splitTheArray`, `removeTails`, and others. The main execution orchestrates the process, leading to the conclusive winner who has achieved multiple heads in a row. 💻

## Output

The Luckiest Person Algorithm, working on the conformative side of randomness, assures a definitive outcome. This approach guarantees a winner who has secured heads multiple times, making it a reliable and intentional selection process. 🏅

## How to Use

Simply integrate the provided code into your JavaScript environment, and witness the Luckiest Person Algorithm in action. The `main` function orchestrates the process, and the result is displayed in a concise table showcasing the ultimate winner, total heads, and toss count. 📊
